Hello! I made this very basic application to get more practice with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. The original course that I used as a guide can be found here 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm4BObh4MhI (thanks Ania!). Working version can be found on my portfolio https://derekprieur.dev/. Below is a list of most of the 
concepts used:

## JavaScript
  - querySelector()
  - Math.floor() & Math.random()
  - addEventListener('click')
  - class.style
  - template strings
  - class.innerHTML

## CSS
  - display: flex
